Troubleshooting
Camera Issues
Ensure your camera is not being used by another application
Check browser permissions for camera access
Try a different camera source if available
Restart the application if camera stops working
Video Processing Issues
Check that uploaded video is in a supported format (MP4, AVI, MOV)
Ensure video file size is within limits
Check server logs for processing errors
